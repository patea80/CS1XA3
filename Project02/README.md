Simple app: Protect the Circle!


Protect the Circle is a web game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game utilizes object-oriented programming to model squares and a circle, alongside with trigonometric models for collision mechanics.

To play, control the circle using arrow keys (or swipe on mobile), and space bar (or tap on mobile) to shoot. The objective is to avoid the squares.

The squares will spawn randomly from the sides at a constant time interval. The score is calculated based on the total number of squares spwaned.
