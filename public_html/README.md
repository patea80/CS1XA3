  Protect the Circle!
Protect the Circle is a web game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game utilizes object-oriented programming to model squares and a circle, alongside with trigonometric models for collision mechanics. To play, control the circle using arrow keys (or swipe on mobile), and space bar (or tap on mobile) to shoot. Remember to avoid the squares! Optimized for mobile devices.
